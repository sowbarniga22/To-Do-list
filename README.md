To-Do List Mobile Application

This mobile application is a simple and efficient To-Do List app developed using Flutter for cross-platform mobile development and designed with Figma for a clean and user-friendly interface. The app enables users to manage their daily tasks easily through basic CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

Features:

Create: Users can add new tasks with relevant details to their to-do list.

Read: The app displays a clear and organized list of all tasks so users can see what needs to be done.

Update: Users have the ability to edit or update existing tasks to reflect changes or additional information.

Delete: Completed or unnecessary tasks can be removed from the list to keep it clutter-free.

The design is optimized for mobile devices, ensuring a consistent and engaging experience. Tasks are saved locally on the device, allowing users to access their to-do list offline.

This project combines the power of Flutter for building smooth, performant apps with the design precision of Figma to deliver a functional and attractive to-do list tool.
